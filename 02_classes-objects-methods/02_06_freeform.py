# Write a script with three classes that model everyday objects.
# - Each class should have an `__init__()` method that sets at least 3 attributes
# - Include a `__str__()` method in each class that prints out the attributes
#     in a nicely formatted string.
# - Overload the `__add__()` method in one of the classes so that it's possible
#     to add attributes of two instances of that class using the `+` operator.
# - Create at least two instances of each class.
# - Once the objects are created, change some of their attribute values.
#
# Be creative. Have some fun. :)
# Using objects you can model anything you want:
# Animals, paintings, card games, sports teams, trees, people etc...
